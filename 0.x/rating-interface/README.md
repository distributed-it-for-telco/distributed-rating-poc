# Rating Interface
The rating interface consists of a suite of canonical `.smithy` files defining the model of shared interaction between the API Gateway actor and Rating Coordinator, Rating Agents actors, and Rating Mocks actors.

This interface is also implemented as a reusable [Rust](./rust) crate.
